2. What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? 
=> Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are very essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content.
   It’s responsible for setting and aligning content within it according to viewport or given device. Containers are defined within the container class (.container). In other words,
   we can say that containers are established the width for the layout to give the content. Elements and content are added within the container.

   Containers are used for many purposes such as –

	It requires use with the default grid system.
	To establish width for the layout to give web content.
	To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.
	To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.
	Bootstrap has the default class or predefined class is “.container” & “.container-fluid” class for  layout. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content 	within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

	Basically, there are three types of container classes available in bootstrap:

	1. Default-Container: The default container uses ‘.container’ class. It provides a responsive fixed-width container.

		Syntax:

			<div class="container">
  					
			</div>

	2. Responsive-Container: Responsive containers are responsive in nature. Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, 	   after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints.

		Syntax:

			<div class="container-sm">Wide for small breakpoint</div>
			<div class="container-md">Wide for medium breakpoint</div>
			<div class="container-lg">Wide for large breakpoint</div>
			<div class="container-xl">Wide for extra large breakpoint</div>
			<div class="container-xxl">Wide for extra large breakpoint</div>

	3. Fluid-Container: Fluid-container uses the ‘.container-fluid’ class. It is used for a full-width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

			Syntax:

				<div class="fluid-container">

				</div>

4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?
=> The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

	1.xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
	2.sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
	3.md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
	4.lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

  Some Bootstrap grid system rules:

	1.Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
	2.Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
	3.Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
	4.Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
	5.Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
	6.Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
	7.Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element
