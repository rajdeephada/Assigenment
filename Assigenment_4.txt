1. What is JavaScript?
=> JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 
   (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

2. What is the use of isNaN function?
=> The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number. Because coercion inside the isNaN() function can be surprising,
    you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN().

3. What is negative Infinity? 
=> NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than 
   the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number. MAX_VALUE) . JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.

4. Which company developed JavaScript?
=> JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript 
   over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.

5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?
=> Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope, while undefined variables are those that have been declared but not given a value.

6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

   generated element. By clicking a button, a modal box appears and collects the required information dynamically.

7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
=> Session state is saved on the server, ViewState is saved in the page. Session state is usually cleared after a period of inactivity from the user 
   (no request happened containing the session id in the request cookies). The view state is posted on subsequent post back in a hidden field.

8. What is === operator?
=> The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality 
   operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?
=> Element Class Names
   Another way to alter the style of an element is by changing its class attribute. class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so in order to access the element's class, 
   you use element. className.

10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?
=>  1. file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.
    2. str = fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.
    3. file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.

11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?
=>  

12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? 
=>  To convert a string to an integer
    parseInt(),
    Number(), 
    Unary operator(+) function is used in javascript. 
    parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn't contain number.
    If a string with a number is sent, 
    then only that number will be returned as the output.

13. What is the function of the delete operator?
=>  The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, 
    the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.

14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript? 
=>  Alert Box :

    An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

    When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.

    Syntax :
             window.alert("sometext");

    Confirm Box :

    A confirm box is often used if you want the user to verify or accept something.

    When a confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.

    If the user clicks "OK", the box returns true. If the user clicks "Cancel", the box returns false.

    Syntax :
             window.confirm("sometext");

    Prompt Box :

    A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

    If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.

    Syntax :
             window.prompt("sometext","defaultText");

15. What is the use of Void (0)?
=>  JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents.
    It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.

16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
=> In JavaScript, we can use window.location object to force a page to load another page. We can use the location object to set the URL of a new page. 
   There are different ways – window.location.href property, window.location.assign() and window.location.replace() methods, to set the URL of a new page using the 
   location object. We will discuss each of the property and methods in detail in this tutorial.

17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
